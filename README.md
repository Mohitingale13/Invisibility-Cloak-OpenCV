# Invisibility-Cloak-OpenCV
Invisibility Cloak project using OpenCV and Python

Welcome to the **Invisibility Cloak** project! This project uses OpenCV and Python to create a magical effect where a green cloth (or any green object) makes the background appear in its place. It's a fun and beginner-friendly way to explore computer vision!

How It Works
1. The program captures the background when you run it.
2. When you step into the frame with a green cloth, the green area is replaced with the background, creating the "invisibility" effect.
3. Press `Q` to exit the program.
